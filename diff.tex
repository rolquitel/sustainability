\section{Introduction}

The global outburst of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has introduced severe concerns regarding the capacity and adaption of healthcare systems and specifically about how vulnerable citizen classes might be affected \citep{lancet2020covid}. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated the most significant transformation and disruption of many services, including healthcare and health emergency management, using digital tools, which have increased rapidly to bring sustainability to health services. \citet{moazzami2020covid} and \citet{katz2020covid} assert that a pandemic seriously alters global health systems in transmission, control, and saturation but also restricts resources and facilities, medical personnel, vaccines, access, and mobility issues. 

Thus, digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, machine learning, the Internet of Things, and extensive health data repositories have contributed to changing and addressing the traditional methods to provide health services to citizens and innovating in different paradigms such as mobility from a disease perspective to patientsâ perspective, well-being citizens and life quality. Moreover, the digital transformation focused on healthcare is continuously impacting medical approaches \citep{sousa2019decision}; \citep{massaro2021digital}. Nowadays, this transformation and innovation implicate new stakeholders conducted by massive patient data from various datasets in different formats, computational intelligence models and algorithms, artificial intelligence-based techniques, novel pervasive platforms for exchanging and monitoring patients, and service providers for obtaining valuable information, patterns, trends and insights in the healthcare domain.

According to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kraus2021digital}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{kraus2021digital}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , there are five research classifications concerning the digital transformation of healthcare: (1) patient-centered technology, (2) operational efficiency of organizations, (3) managerial implications, (4) impact on workforce practice, and (5) socio-economic aspects. By taking into consideration this categorization, sustainability in healthcare should cover all these issues to adopt new strategies, methodologies, and innovative applications to provide health value services-based technologies and responses to face a future and global health emergency in the global world.

Since the outbreak and lockdown restrictions worldwide by the COVID-19 pandemic, diverse initiatives to maintain the activity of health services have been implemented. For instance, virtual medical consultations have increased in many countries \citep{banerjee2020teleconsultation}, and some medical departments go on using online technology to monitor non-critical patients \citep{pinar2021preliminary}; \citep{tamayo2020evaluation}. According to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{shahed2021supply}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{shahed2021supply}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , the pandemic has disturbed the supply chains around the world, generating issues related to supporting the medical responses, lack of essential medical supplies, deficiency in accessing and mobility to clinical and hospitals to treat medical specialties, and the resilience of citizens. Indeed, 94%DIF <  of Fortune 1000 companies are suffering interruptions in their supply chains, 75% of these companies have experimented a negative impact on their business operations, and 55% of these companies are scheduling to reduce their growth plans.

Thus, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{rosenbaum2020untold} }%DIFAUXCMD
presented a study that asserted }\DIFaddend the pandemic transformed the use of health services to attend to different emergency conditions in patients without COVID-19, showing a general reduction in the treatment of medical specialties. The study suggests that this phenomenon is due to (1) negligence by patients with severe or life-threatening disorders to pursue care, (2) release of the emergency units for non-emergency disorders, or (3) displacement of emergency unit care to other locations, such as telemedicine consultations. Moreover, the analytical study reported at least in the United States, the visits and admissions to emergency units decreased by more than 40%DIF <  in all the healthcare systems. This fact was probably generated by the citizens' response to the sanitary emergency messaging concerning COVID-19 in the country. Thus, the population avoided assisting emergency units because of the fear of being exposed to the virus, particularly in these healthcare spaces.

}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin {\DIFadd{According to \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{kumar2016approaches}}%DIFAUXCMD
, the recommendation task is considered like classification and ranking prediction model. Consequently, there are different and widely used techniques to generate such recommendations. In this context, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{lika2014facing} }%DIFAUXCMD
categorized five approaches in the recommender systems: (1) Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique that recommends elements to the user considering previous characteristics of other users with similar conditions based on user profiles. (2) Content-based Filtering (CB) suggests elements that are similar to others based on a given previous user profile. (3) Social Filtering (SF) that recommends elements considering suggestions and preferences taken from social networks (particularly friends). (4) Knowledge-based System (KB) recommends elements to the users relating particular domain knowledge considering a similarity value to assess the matching grade; and (5) Hybrid Technique (HB) combines two techniques to recommend elements to the user.}}  

{\DIFadd{There are different research issues and challenges concerning those approaches to improve the recommendations in recommender systems. Thus, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{kumar2016approaches} }%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{lika2014facing} }%DIFAUXCMD
described a relevant research gap in implicit and explicit methods to collect ratings for the matrix, which reflects a $sparsity$ problem in which there are no scores to know the satisfaction level of users. The $cold-start$ problem is associated with missing information concerning offering recommendations to new users in the system because it does not have ratings to initiate the task. Moreover, the $scalability$ issue is a big challenge because it is difficult to find open architectures and algorithms to increase the functionality of the recommender systems and handle dynamic and large datasets or preferencesâ collections. Concerning the $privacy\ and\ robustness$ problems is essential to guarantee the users that their preferences and confidential information are safe in the system. Thus, $cybersecurity$ approaches are needed to ensure the data of users and the confidence to access the recommender systems. In addition, $recommenders\ in\ mobile\ devices$ are relevant to design a new generation of RS focused on location-based services. Nowadays, geographic information plays an important role to generate recommendations for many services, employing social media information to analyze preferences and tastes. Thus, it demands more computational solutions concerning effective mobile user interfaces and efficient algorithms to retrieve information on the preferences and tastes of users. Finally, the $diversity\ of\ items$ implies the inference and knowledge discovery based on novel techniques to provide particular recommendations, considering a broad scenario of preferences. To date, there is little research related to this issue to improve the accuracy of the recommendations.}}

{\DIFadd{Considering the challenges of the state-of-the-art, we propose an approach centered to tackle issues related to recommenders in mobile devices and the diversity of items in the healthcare domain. Thus, we focused on incorporating semantic and geospatial processing in a particular RS as well as an attention factor index to generate recommendations to users based on medical specialties and their near facilities.}}

\DIFaddend Therefore, we perceive the following issues concerning medical attention: less attention has been focused on geographic access to health services, hospital access, response capacity at the local level within urban areas, and lack of access to medical specialties according to the responsiveness and infrastructure. Thus, we propose a novel approach based on patient-centered technology. In this way, we have designed a recommender system that consists of a health service level, which is defined by a health attention factor. This metric is composed of two key components, the geospatial location of the health facilities and the medical specialties required by the patients.

The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{main contribution of this research work is related to the health attention factor that takes into consideration different criteria to compute the recommendation list based on the following: user-required specialty, current location, arrival time from some volunteer-collaborative service (Google Maps or Wazee), medical facility, occupation factor, number of medical doctors classified by specialty, and similarity metric.  Finally, this is a customizable approach because some criteria could be modified to meet other requirements, such as buffer distance, similarity metric, and among others.
}

\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend rest of the paper is structured as follows: the next section comprises the literature review on intelligent systems and approaches focused on health services, and their implications during the COVID-19 pandemic, Section 3 describes the methodology, Section 4 investigates the results, and the last section discusses the key findings of our research.

On the other hand, with the health crisis that has tied the world in recent years, telemedicine services have been essential for many users to access health services beyond this required assistance by the pandemic emergency related to COVID-19. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

So, in this context is necessary to understand what is required of a new type of company that provides health services using new remote work technologies. \citet{chakraborty2021health} attempts to understand the status of these health technology companies in providing healthcare services through a study of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend scientific publications on the matter. With a total of 110 journals reviewed, 76 articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria, and only five studies portrayed the status of new health technology companies in the provision of healthcare services. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Acceptance of services depends on the effectiveness and affordability of the service. }\DIFdelend Similar results are presented \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{qahtan2022review}}%DIFAUXCMD
, based on three main objectives such as identifying research gaps, challenges, and open problems in the academic literature. So, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{qahtan2022review}}%DIFAUXCMD
, the }\DIFaddend study concluded that despite the efforts to develop safer and more private systems for the health industry, none meets the necessary development attributes.

Another critical aspect to consider \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and arise based on the experience of using remote health services during the COVID-19 pandemic }\DIFdelend is that access to these services must be viable and available to all people regardless of their socioeconomic status. For this reason, there must be criteria for evaluating health technologies (HTA). According to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{drummond2022challenges}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{drummond2022challenges}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , there are a few challenges to such an evaluation, taking into account that resources are limited to run HTAs locally. Another problem is the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{limited availability of local }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{low availability of domestic }\DIFaddend data to complete the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{economic }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{profitable }\DIFaddend models and the timely \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{availability of relevant }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{readiness of pertinent }\DIFaddend HTAs, among others. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A further group of challenges is related to the structural characteristics of the health system. These include central or local restrictions on using HTAs or differences in how reimbursement decisions are made in different infrastructures. }\DIFdelend Many Latin American countries have parallel health systems in which mandatory health insurance or social security systems for workers, subsidized public programs, and private mechanisms coexist. \citet{meleddu2020public} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mentions }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{asserted }\DIFaddend that research has shown that people make health spending decisions based on their income, political \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attitudes}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ideology}\DIFaddend , and demographics\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and tend to see }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; and be liable to notice }\DIFaddend public healthcare as a normal good that is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hardly available. Users }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{barely available. Thus, users }\DIFaddend demand health services that meet their expectations. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Health spending is related to the health services that a patient can access.
}\DIFdelend 

In general, we consider that patients can have access to public health services, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which vary in quality depending on each country. Some }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{some }\DIFaddend other patients have \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{also }\DIFaddend access to private health services\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend that are more expensive. Therefore, public services often cannot provide health services remotely, making it necessary for people to travel efficiently to the most convenient health centers. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In citep}%DIFDELCMD < {%%%

Thus, applying policies that impact the quality of health services is critical. For example, \citet{sharma2021public} presents the accessibility measure for health services by using public transport, the travel time, and the number of transit stops. In addition, \citet{PEREIRA2021113773} shows how transport-accessibility analytics can provide actionable insights to improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{By using network distance metrics, the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities is computed. They then use the balanced-floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in hospital access.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A large amount }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Medical professionals have a lot }\DIFaddend of medical information\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has brought many difficulties for medical professionals }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which has made it difficult }\DIFaddend to make patient-oriented decisions. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These difficulties lead us to the need to apply recommendation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Recommender }\DIFaddend systems (RS) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the healthcare domain to help both patients and medical professionals to make more efficient and accuratehealth-related decisions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can help in making such decisions so that they are more accurate}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The PRISMA framework has been used to provide information on the approaches and strategies used in the recommendation areas.

}

\DIFaddend \citet{narducci2015recommender} presented a social network called HealthNet, where a recommendation component is integrated to suggest the doctors and hospitals that best fit a specific patient profile. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In HealthNet, a patiententers their }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Based on patient's }\DIFaddend health data, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{such as conditions, treatments (drugs, surgeries, or side effects), health indicators (blood pressure, body mass index, blood levels, etc.), doctors consulted, and hospitalisations. Based on the input data, the system searches for similar patients stored in the database }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the database is searched for patients with similar conditions. }\DIFaddend (Eqn. \ref{eqn:sim_pacientes}).

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:sim_pacientes}
	s(a,b)  = \alpha \frac{\sum_{c_a\in C_a,c_b\in C_b} s_c(c_a, c_b)}{|C_a|+|C_b|} + (1-\alpha)\frac{\sum_{t_a\in T_a,t_b\in T_b} s_t(t_a, t_b)}{|T_a|+|T_b|}
\end{equation}
where $a$ y $b$ are patients, $C_x$ is the set of conditions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that afflict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend the patient $x$, $T_x$ is the set of treatments for the patient $x$, $\alpha$ is a parameter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that allows regulating the relationship between the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for regulating the ratio between }\DIFaddend contributions of conditions and treatments. $s_c(c_a, c_b)$ is the similarity between two conditions: in the case that $c_a = c_b$ the similarity $s_c(c_a, c_b) = \log \frac{|C|}{|P_{c_a}|}$, being $C$ the universe of conditions and $P_{c_a}$ is the set of patients with condition $c_a$; in the case that $c_a \neq c_b$ the similarity $s_c(c_a, c_b) = \frac{1}{\delta (c_a,c_b)}$, being $\delta$ the length of the shortest path between $c_a$ y $c_b$ in the hierarchy of diseases. $s_t(t_a, t_b)$ is the similarity between two treatments \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend and is equal to 1 if $t_a = t_b$, 0 otherwise.

Now, based on this similarity of patients, a rating is calculated for doctors (Eqn. \ref{eqn_scoreDoc}) and hospitals (Eqn. \ref{eqn:scoreH}) with respect to patient $p$.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn_scoreDoc}
	scoreDoc(d,p) = \sum_{\rho \in P}s(p,\rho)\cdot r_\rho (d)
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the set of registered patients and $r_\rho (d)$ is the rating given by the patient $\rho$ to the doctor $d$.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:scoreH}
	scoreH(h,p) = \beta \left( \sum_{\rho \in P} s(p, \rho) \cdot r_\rho(h) \right) + (1-\beta) \cdot Q(h)
\end{equation}
where $r_\rho (h)$ is the rating given by the patient $\rho$ to the hospital $h$ and $Q(h)$ is a quality index of the hospital $h$ given by a rating authority.


\section{The proposed approach}

According to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{neutens2015accessibility}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{neutens2015accessibility}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , the most common parameter to measure geographic access to healthcare services is the shortest distance or travel time to arrive near a medical unit. This metric is widely used and easy to compute and analyze, and therefore clear for conveying to policymakers. However, the most critical limitation of this metric is that it discharges the traffic congestion and the implicit events that originate from this condition. There are other potential approaches, such as the Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods \citep{matthews2019using}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which computes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Thus, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{matthews2019using} }%DIFAUXCMD
computed the }\DIFaddend accessibility levels considering the following variables: the provider-to-population ratio of every health unit and the potential health demand regarding the infrastructure. Nevertheless, the limitation of this method concerns the overestimation of both health service demand and supply, which could induce untruthful accessibility estimation values.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Thus}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Therefore}\DIFaddend , we propose a novel approach based on patient-centered technology according to the classification proposed by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kraus2021digital}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{kraus2021digital}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . In this way, we design a recommender system that consists of a health service level defined by a health attention factor. This metric is composed of two key components, the geospatial location of the health facilities and the medical specialties required by the patients. 

The approach consists of a recommender system of health services considering the geographic location, the medical specialties defined within an application ontology, and the attention factor to offer the best health unit to treat a medical situation. So, when a medical condition is presented, the patient requires assistance at a medical facility for partial or complete medical attention. In this case, two scenarios could be presented: (1) the patient can readily identify the adequate medical unit by making a query in the recommender system, and it returns a set of medical centers to the patient according to geographic location criteria. (2) However, there is no \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a priori }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{a priori}} \DIFaddend information about the most acceptable hospital for attending the emergency patient. It is possible that the nearest hospital does not have a doctor with a neurology specialty; so, according to this medical situation, a recommender system semantically processes the query to provide information concerning this health service. Therefore, the recommender system performs the following duties: semantic-based recommendations, profiling of answers, and map rendering. Figure~\ref{fig:arquitectura} presents the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{architecture and components }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{processes }\DIFaddend of the recommender system to retrieve semantic medical information about the medical centers.

\subsection{The medical application ontology}

The medical application ontology was designed for semantic processing. This ontology conceptualizes the most essential medical specialties considering the Association of American Medical Colleges Standard (https://www.aamc.org/cim/). In this context, other medical ontologies were created according to their applications such as SNOMED \citep{cornet2008forty}, MedO \citep{fujita2010multiviews}, OBI Ontology \citep{bandrowski2016ontology}, GALEN \citep{rector2006ontological}, Gene Ontology \citep{gene2019gene}, among others.

Those ontological representations are built with diverse \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{languages }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{computational environments }\DIFaddend such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), Ontology Web Language (OWL), and Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO)\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; all of them based on a symbolic language}\DIFaddend . The structures and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{syntaxes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{syntaxis }\DIFaddend to describe entities and relationships are very complex, and they contain up to 900,000 concepts in their topological structure. These features are difficult and slow to be semantically processed, and the medical specialties are not explicitly defined in such ontologies. Moreover, the interoperability of these public ontologies is a big challenge because, in production systems, the performance can decrease \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{significatively }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{significantly }\DIFaddend to several issues such as diverse access to different ontologies, translation among languages, different reasoning, and inference engines to provide semantic information from queries, and semantic information integration techniques.

Thus, the proposed research proposes an application ontology that consists of a hierarchical structure based on an is-a relationship, with partitions associated with medical specialties. Summing up, the proposed ontology fits with the recommendations generated by the system with a conceptualization more suitable for querying medical specialties due to a single hierarchical description, specialized partitions, and granularity. We develop the proposed ontology with OWL-full language using the ProtÃ©gÃ© application with version 5.5. The root node of the ontology has three properties to perform the semantic processing: the first one establishes if the medical specialty is âdiagnosticâ or âtherapeuticâ. The second property \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{designates the age scale of patients }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{specifies the patient age defined by }\DIFaddend (âpediatricâ, âadultâ, âgeriatricâ, âallâ), and the third \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{describes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{depicts }\DIFaddend if the medical specialty is âorgan-basedâ, âtechnique-basedâ or âbothâ. Figure~\ref{fig:ontologia} shows the application ontology to conceptualize \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend medical specialties.

		\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{onto.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Application ontology representing medical specialties\label{fig:ontologia}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The profiling and semantic processing tasks}

The profiling task establishes a user \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{profile }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{personalization (profile) }\DIFaddend and the statement of the search \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{type}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(query type)}\DIFaddend . So, the profile for each query \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contains the following information}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is composed of the following features}\DIFaddend :

\begin{itemize}
\item Health Service Type. The user \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{specifies if he requires public or private }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{defines if he demands private or public }\DIFaddend health services.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{;
}\DIFdelend \item Medical Facilities. All units, centers, and hospitals that accomplish the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{type of health service }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{health service type }\DIFaddend are shown.
\item Medical Specialties. They \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{require to select the specialties for each unit or hospital previously enrolled}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{must identify the disciplines for each previously enlisted institution or medical center}\DIFaddend .
\end{itemize}

The semantic processing task is in charge of receiving the search type as an input parameter. The value of the search type defines the query to build in the application ontology using the SPARQL language. In this way, the semantic information concerning the medical centers, units, or hospitals is retrieved by taking into consideration the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{userâs statements }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{statements of the user}\DIFaddend .

Moreover, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{search type }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{type of type }\DIFaddend assumes one of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{three }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the following }\DIFaddend potential values: general, emergency, or profile-oriented. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the general }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Regarding the general type of }\DIFaddend search, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{list of retrieved }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{retrieved list of }\DIFaddend medical facilities is ranked \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{according to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{taking into account }\DIFaddend the geospatial distances \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{measured by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that were measured according to }\DIFaddend the userâs \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{position. In consequence}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{location. In conclusion}\DIFaddend , the first medical facility is the nearest \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{patient. In case of emergency }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{user's patient. So, in an emergency case}\DIFaddend , the âERâ string is allocated to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{search type variable}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variable 
 of search type}\DIFaddend , and the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{previous steps }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{preceding operations }\DIFaddend are made, but the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{query outcome only }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{outcome just }\DIFaddend has medical facilities that supply emergency services. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In }\DIFaddend a profile-oriented query, all \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{data stored }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the information provided }\DIFaddend in the user\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{profile is employed to ask about }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s account is used to find }\DIFaddend the closest medical facilities \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with the medical specialties described in the profile. The final result of this task is a list }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that offer the medical specializations mentioned in the account. This task will produce a collection }\DIFaddend of hospitals represented by the set $MF=\left\{mf_{1},mf_{2},\dots,\,mf_{n}\right\}$, where $MF$ is the set of medical facilities, centers, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{units }\DIFdelend or hospitals. 

\subsection{The ranking attention factor}

We propose a novel ranking algorithm for determining the health attention factor and sorting the medical facilities that accomplish a medical specialty. So, the algorithm computes the attention feature for a collection of medical units, centers, or hospitals numerically. For example, in an emergency such as a heart attack, it is desirable a doctor with a cardiology specialty to care about the patient. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Nevertheless}\DIFaddend , in the case that this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{medical }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{doctor or }\DIFaddend specialist is unavailable, it is critical to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{compute the semantic similarity }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{calculate the semantic similitude }\DIFaddend and identify all potential physicians with some corresponding knowledge \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{competencies }\DIFaddend for treating the patient. 

Consequently, we design the following equation to determine the number of doctors who can respond to an emergency involving a particular medical discipline.

\subsection{The map rendering task}
This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{task interprets the obtained results from the ranking algorithmto display the medical facilities }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{work utilizes Google Maps API version 2 to interpret the ranking algorithm's output and represent the healthcare centers }\DIFaddend on a map\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{using Google Maps API version 2. Therefore, we employ this map server because the downloading, visualization, and responding times for requests in mobile devices are optimal, in constrast with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. In contrast to }\DIFaddend other map servers\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend such as Yahoo Maps \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend and Microsoft Bing Maps, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{among others}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and among others, this map server provides superior download rate, display, and response times for mobile devices}\DIFaddend . Moreover, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it is possible to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we }\DIFaddend use a temporal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{layer to add different visual analysis options }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tile to add further visual analysis possibilities }\DIFaddend (markers, polygons, route lines\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and change of map type}\DIFdelend ). This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{task processes the data input that contains a geographically ordered (general }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{activity analyses the incoming data containing ordered geographically (generic }\DIFaddend and oriented-profile queries) or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ranked (emergency search) list of hospitals to add }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sorted (urgent situation query) collection of institutions to count }\DIFaddend markers for all medical facilities \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{enlisted }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{included }\DIFaddend in the input list. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{So, a }\DIFaddend geographic marker represents each medical facility, and a label \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that contains the name and related information of every medical center, the address, and the distance are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{containing the facility's name, and address. In addition the distance is }\DIFaddend measured in kilometers. So, to obtain an estimation of the time required to arrive at the desired location, we operate with Google Directions API. The developed query has the following pattern:

\begin{center}
\begin{dmath}
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?\\
origin=$latitude\_origin,longitude\_origin$\& \\
destination=$latitude\_destination,longitude\_destination$\& \\
key=$YOUR\_API\_KEY$
\end{dmath}
\end{center}

On the order hand, it is possible to compute the geographic distance between the two locations (origin and destination), applying the Haversine function \cite{sinnott1984virtues}. See Equations \ref{eq_geographic_distance} - \ref{eq_c}.\\

\begin{equation}
\label{eq_geographic_distance}
distance(o(lat_1, lon_1), d(lat_2, lon_2)) = R \times c
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq_a}
a = sin^2 { \left( \frac{rad \left( \Delta_{lat} \right)}{2} \right) } + cos \left( rad(x_1) \right) \times cos \left( rad(x_2) \right) \times sin^2 { \left( \frac{rad \left( \Delta_{lon} \right)}{2} \right) }
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq_c}
c = deg \left( 2 \times arcsin \left( min(1, \sqrt{a}) \right) \right)
\end{equation}

Where: \\
$\Delta_{lon}=lon_2 - lon_1$ is the longitude coordinates difference. \\ 
$\Delta_{lat}=lat_2 - lat_1$ is the latitude coordinates difference. \\
$rad(value)$ is a function to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{convert }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transform }\DIFaddend $value$ from degrees to radians. \\
$deg(value)$ is a function to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{convert }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{transform }\DIFaddend $value$ from radians to degrees. \\
$R$ equal to $6378.137$ kilometers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend is the Earth\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s }\DIFaddend radius. \\

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, the complete pseudocode }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin {\DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{wu2021l1} }%DIFAUXCMD
proposed an L$^3$F model to deal efficiently with the high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices coming from the recommender system.

In said combination, the weights of the $L_1$ and $L_2$ norms are adaptively adjusted \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{li2022diversified, wu2021latent}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Experiments showed that the model increases in robustness (due to the $L_1$ norm) and stability (due to the $L_2$ norm) when dealing with a HiDS matrix with outliers. Thus, we used a loss function based on $L_1$.}}

{\DIFadd{On the other hand, the complete pseudo-code }\DIFaddend of this proposal is described in Algorithm \ref{algorithm_attention_factor}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This algorithm describes all the steps required to compute the adequate medical unit by combining the arrival times of all hospitals and the estimation of the attention factor; thus, we used a loss function based on L$_1$. In addition, this approach considers the medical specialty required by the mobile application user, their current location, and the specialties and medical doctors in each medical facility. Once the ranked list has been determined, the directions list must be requested to arrive from the current user's location to the high-ranked medical facility using Google directions. Then, from the response body, it is possible to obtain the point list to reach the target hospital.}}

\section{\DIFadd{Conclusion and future work}}
\DIFadd{In this }\DIFaddend paper, we propose a methodological and collaborative architecture to promote the assistance of citizens to medical facilities. The approach consists of a recommender system in which the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{metric }\DIFdelend health attention factor \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{metric }\DIFaddend assesses which medical facility, center, unit, or hospital with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend better infrastructure and diverse health specialties is available to bring attention to patients. Thus, the proposed attention factor quantitatively computes the lower \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{number of patientsat an emergency}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{value concerning the patients' number at a medical crisis (emergency) }\DIFaddend and semantically the number of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{medical specialties , as well as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{health specialties and }\DIFaddend the economic costs for the medical service. In addition, the geographic location ranks the medical facilities according to the user profile of the citizens, and the visualization is carried out in a Web-GIS application.

As collateral findings, we conclude that the efficient control of traffic congestion addressed the access to hospitals and facilities to provide health services according to geographic location and medical specialties. So, it is a critical challenge that highly urbanized spaces such as Mexico City are facing. While such unexpected events are tough to avoid, novel computation and quick broadcast information about alternative routes could be the only way to decrease the loss of lives in health emergencies and services. 

Thus, medical emergency responses require quick and reliable access and optimal routing. We know that road networks in a megalopolis are becoming increasingly complex, and the density of traffic congestion are rising continuously at least in Mexico City. Indeed, recommender systems \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the healthcare context }\DIFaddend should be oriented towards improving health services by incorporating filtering approaches to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{multicriteria }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{multi-criteria }\DIFaddend evaluation for health emergency routing services. Moreover, the new medical necessities require intelligent and automatic decision support considering the dynamic situation around the world.

\DIFaddbegin {\DIFadd{On the other hand, the research limitations of the present approach are oriented toward the dependency on the Google Directions API service to obtain the estimations and approximations for the arrival time to the medical facilities. This occurs because the companies that manage huge data volumes based on volunteered geographic information (VGI) do not share this information, and the data are not open and public. }\DIFaddend In this sense, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we assume that the responsibility of clinicians and public health officials is to emphasize to patients the significance of ongoing attending the medical centers, units, or hospitals to receive appropriate treatments, not only in emergencies but also for continuous and progressive actions to follow diseases. Nevertheless, patient-centered technology has demonstrated an innovative performance in managing and monitoring clinical settings, providing sustainable actions for the well-being of citizens.}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{our recommendation consists of developing frameworks based on VGI and crowd-sensing to generate massive data related to traffic congestion and other connected events. Concerning the semantic similarity measure, it is necessary to incorporate new measures to assess the information retrieval of the medical specialties, such as other semantic similarity measures, but considering the high computational cost. Therefore, we suggest implementing the DIS-C, which is a conceptual distance measure proposed by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{quintero2019dis} }%DIFAUXCMD

%\section{Introduction}

%The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal paper \cite{ref-journal}. Now citing a book reference \cite{ref-book1,ref-book2} or other reference types \cite{ref-unpublish,ref-communication,ref-proceeding}. Please use the command \citep{ref-thesis,ref-url} for the following MDPI journals, which use author--date citation: Administrative Sciences, Arts, Econometrics, Economies, Genealogy, Humanities, IJFS, Journal of Intelligence, Journalism and Media, JRFM, Languages, Laws, Religions, Risks, Social Sciences, Literature.

%\section{Materials and Methods}

%Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

%Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly avail-able database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

%Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

%\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

%This is the example 1 of equation:
%\begin{linenomath}
%\begin{equation}
%a = 1,
%\end{equation}
%\end{linenomath}
%the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

%This is the example 2 of equation:
%\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
%\begin{equation}
%a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
%\end{equation}
%\end{adjustwidth}

% Example of a page in landscape format (with table and table footnote).
%\startlandscape
%\begin{table}[H] %% Table in wide page
%\caption{This is a very wide table.\label{tab3}}
%	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{CCCC}
